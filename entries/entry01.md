Physics, one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, helps us understand how the universe behaves. it consist of many subtopics that all help to understand why this happens when that happens. Physics include a lot of calculations and many formulas that aids with the experiments on the subtopics of physics (ex. Gravity). This study has a wide range of what someone can learn. it defines everything we do and attempts to solve many phenomenon. Physics uses the metric system over the US system because the metric system uses multiples of 10 when converting units.
